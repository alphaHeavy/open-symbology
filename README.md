open-symbology
==============

This project implements [BSYM](http://bsym.bloomberg.com) for manipulating tickers. It is possible to build lists of traded securities with this data. I have only used it to build the universe of US Equities so the parser may need to be extended for other security types.

Note: This project is not associated with Bloomberg and neither Bloomberg or its affiliates(s) endorses it in any way.
